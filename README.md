## Introduction
Pigmented skin lesions refer to any skin abnormality that appears darker than the surrounding area due to melanin or blood.

Range from benign moles to malignant melanoma.

## Motivation
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), skin cancer represents a considerable share of all cancer diagnoses globally, contributing significantly to cancer-related health burdens and fatalities.
